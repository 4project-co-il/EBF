Version 0.1.4
	EBF_I2C class implementation
	All timers related APIs moved to 32bit to increase possible sleep timer
	EBF_Serial varible can be declared without interface, by default Serial will be used for AVR chips, SerialUSB for SAMD21
	IRQ LOW and HIGH modes added for SAMD21
	SAMD21 Interrupts are now working in deep sleep mode

Version 0.1.3
	Adding SAMD21 interrupts support
	Fix in EBF_Serial to proprly support SAMD21 Uart class instead of HardwareSerial

Version 0.1.2
	Adding EBF_Servo product abstraction layer class. Requires installation of Arduino's Servo library
	Adding HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor product abstraction layer class
	Adding SAMD21 support
	Adding SAMD21 power saving
	Change EBF_Serial implementation to support both HardwareSerial instances (Serial, Serial0, Serial1 etc.) and SAMD's SerialUSB instance
	Changes in interrupts implementation to get it closer to SAMD implementation needs. Current code doesn't implement SAMD's interrupts.

Version 0.1.1
	Adding EBF_ERROR_CODE, 0 = OK, anything else is an error code

Version 0.1.0
	Initial Core code, implementing the EBF logic, Timers, MessageQueue, DigitalInput, DigitalOutput, AnalogInput, PwmOutput, Serial
	Initial Products code, implementing Led, Button, Relay, Switch, Potentiometer
	Examples for all the code
