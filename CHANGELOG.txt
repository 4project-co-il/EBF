Version 0.1.3
	Adding SAMD21 interrupts support
	Fix in EBF_Serial to proprly support SAMD21 Uart class instead of HardwareSerial

Version 0.1.2
	Adding EBF_Servo product abstraction layer class. Requires installation of Arduino's Servo library
	Adding HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor product abstraction layer class
	Adding SAMD21 support
	Adding SAMD21 power saving
	Change EBF_Serial implementation to support both HardwareSerial instances (Serial, Serial0, Serial1 etc.) and SAMD's SerialUSB instance
	Changes in interrupts implementation to get it closer to SAMD implementation needs. Current code doesn't implement SAMD's interrupts.

Version 0.1.1
	Adding EBF_ERROR_CODE, 0 = OK, anything else is an error code

Version 0.1.0
	Initial Core code, implementing the EBF logic, Timers, MessageQueue, DigitalInput, DigitalOutput, AnalogInput, PwmOutput, Serial
	Initial Products code, implementing Led, Button, Relay, Switch, Potentiometer
	Examples for all the code
