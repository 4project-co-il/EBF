Version 0.3.0
	Interrupts code enhancement. EBF_DIRECT_CALL_FROM_ISR compilation flag allowing direct calls from ISRs.
	EBF_Seeed_Monochrome_GROVE_16x2_LCD implementation. LCD based on the AiP31068 I2C driver.
	Adding GetValue() API to EBF_Led class. All modules data should be self-contained from now on.
	EEPROMs burning programs separated to it's own repo: https://github.com/4project-co-il/PlugAndPlay-EEPROMs
	Separation of the Plug-n-Play code to a separate library: https://github.com/4project-co-il/PlugAndPlay

Version 0.2.0
	Adding PnP (Plug-and-Play) logic code
	Adding several PnP devices support
	Bugfixes in EBF code

Version 0.1.6
	Arduino IDE Library Manager updates
	PlatformIO Libraries Registry updates

Version 0.1.5
	I2C and API related fixes
	Change in interrupt registering and processing flow
	EBF_STTS22H_TemperatureSensor implementation, which can use interrupts and call the callback function on temperature high/low level detection

Version 0.1.4
	EBF_I2C class implementation
	All timers related APIs moved to 32bit to increase possible sleep timer
	EBF_Serial varible can be declared without interface, by default Serial will be used for AVR chips, SerialUSB for SAMD21
	IRQ LOW and HIGH modes added for SAMD21
	SAMD21 Interrupts are now working in deep sleep mode

Version 0.1.3
	Adding SAMD21 interrupts support
	Fix in EBF_Serial to proprly support SAMD21 Uart class instead of HardwareSerial

Version 0.1.2
	Adding EBF_Servo product abstraction layer class. Requires installation of Arduino's Servo library
	Adding HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor product abstraction layer class
	Adding SAMD21 support
	Adding SAMD21 power saving
	Change EBF_Serial implementation to support both HardwareSerial instances (Serial, Serial0, Serial1 etc.) and SAMD's SerialUSB instance
	Changes in interrupts implementation to get it closer to SAMD implementation needs. Current code doesn't implement SAMD's interrupts.

Version 0.1.1
	Adding EBF_ERROR_CODE, 0 = OK, anything else is an error code

Version 0.1.0
	Initial Core code, implementing the EBF logic, Timers, MessageQueue, DigitalInput, DigitalOutput, AnalogInput, PwmOutput, Serial
	Initial Products code, implementing Led, Button, Relay, Switch, Potentiometer
	Examples for all the code
