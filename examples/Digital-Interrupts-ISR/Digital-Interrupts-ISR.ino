// This example demonstrates the advanced use of hardwre interrupts with the Event Based Framework - EBF
// By default, the EBF core doesn't use interrupts and that part of the code is not compiled to save memory.
// Since interrupts are more advanced topic, there are few things to be done in order to use that code.
// To have the interrupts processing code compiled, the library needs the EBF_USE_INTERRUPTS flag to be defined
// project wide.
// For this advanced example, you will also need the EBF_DIRECT_CALL_FROM_ISR flag, which will enable the EBF
// to call your functions directly from the ISR (Interrupt Service Routine).
// If you're using the PlatformIO environment, you could add the following line to the project platform.ini file:
// build_flags =
//     -D EBF_USE_INTERRUPTS
//     -D EBF_DIRECT_CALL_FROM_ISR
//
// Since the Arduino IDE doesn't provide any way to add project wide definitions, there is additional way to add that
// flag to the compilation...
// In the library src directory you will find the "EBF_Config_TEMPLATE.h" file, which include all the configuration
// flags for the EBF library.
// If you're using PlatformIO, you can save the content of that file as "Project_Config.h" file in your project "include"
// directory.
// If you're using Arduino IDE, copy that file and save it's content as "Project_Config.h" file in the library "src" directory
//
// In the "Project_Config.h" file you will find the flag definition commented out:
// #define EBF_USE_INTERRUPTS
// #define EBF_DIRECT_CALL_FROM_ISR
// Uncomment those lines to have the interrupts code to be compiled into the EBF library

// The callback function for the digital input change
// Since interrupts are enabled for that example, and direct ISR calls as well,
// the function will be called as an ISR - Interrupt Service Routine.
// You can do whatever you need in the ISR, as in regular function, but the operation
// should be fast. It is advised not to use Serial or other communication channels
// directly from the ISR since other interrupts are not processed while the function
// is executed, hence some buffers might overflow. Printing small messages is OK.
// If you have a longer task, you can return the control to EBF, which will use internal
// message queue to pass the execution from ISR level to normal run, and will call the
// same function again to process the logic of the digital input change from the normal run mode.

void setup()
{
	// EBF is the first thing that should be initialized, with the maximum timers to be used
	// Second parameter of the EBF Init function is the message queue size used to pass messages
	// from interrupt to normal run. Think of it as a global flag flipped to indicate that
	// there was an interrupt and additional processing should be done after it was detected
	// The number of message is something very specific to the project and you will have to
	// experiment with that. There might be one interrupt source that will generate big amount
	// of messages, on the other hand there might be many sources for interrupts that arrive
	// very slow, so the normal run will be able to execute them between the interrupts and
	// only one message might be enough
	//
	// We set the message queue here to 4 for that example.
	// You can use the EBF.GetNumberOfMessages() function to see number of message in the queue
	// at any time. And the EBF.GetMaxNumberOfMessages() function to see the total maximal
	// number the message queue reached during the program run.
	// Those function might help you tune the system to get to the right needed message queue
	// size and save some RAM memory if needed.
